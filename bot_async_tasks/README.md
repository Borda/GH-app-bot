# GitHub App Bot for CI Management

## Overview

The `bot_async_tasks` module is a lightweight Python application within the GitHub-app-bot project, designed to manage continuous integration (CI) tasks for GitHub repositories.
It processes webhook events from GitHub, such as pull request openings, updates, or reviews, to automate validation and testing based on repository-specific rules.
Powered by the Lightning platform (from lightning.ai), it leverages distributed computing for scalable execution, allowing tests to run across multiple environments like different Python versions, operating systems, and hardware (CPU/GPU).
This setup supports a pay-per-use model with spot instances for cost efficiency, making it suitable for automated code quality assurance in development workflows.

Research suggests that such bots improve CI efficiency by reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent rule enforcement.
The name "async_tasks" indicates an asynchronous approach to handling tasks, likely using Python's asyncio library to manage concurrent event processing without blocking the main thread.

## Concurrency Solution

In GitHub bots, webhook events can arrive frequently, and sequential processing can lead to bottlenecks, delaying CI responses.
The `bot_async_tasks` addresses this with an asynchronous concurrency model, probably using asyncio to create coroutines for each event.
This allows the bot to handle I/O-bound operations (like API calls to GitHub or Lightning) non-blocking, improving responsiveness.

**For example**

- Upon receiving a webhook, the server parses the payload and launches an async task to process the event.
- Tasks can run concurrently using `asyncio.gather` or an event loop, with safeguards like semaphores to limit simultaneous executions if needed.
- Integration with Lightning adds distributed concurrency, where tasks are dispatched to remote workers for parallel execution across environments.

This approach is more efficient than traditional threading for I/O-heavy workloads due to lower overhead and better scalability. However, for CPU-bound tasks, it might combine with multiprocessing.
The design balances simplicity for small apps with performance for larger repositories, avoiding complex queues like Celery.

## How to Start

Assuming you have the project files and dependencies set up, follow these steps to configure and run the bot:

1. **Create a GitHub App**:

   - Navigate to GitHub Developer Settings and create a new app.
   - Grant read/write permissions for "Checks" and "Pull Requests".
   - Subscribe to "Pull Request" events.
   - Record the App ID, generate a private key (.pem file), and set a webhook secret for security.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Use the `.env` template to set up required variables:
     ```
     GITHUB_APP_ID=your_app_id
     GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=(paste the full content from the .pem file)
     WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret
     LIGHTNING_API_KEY=your_lightning_api_key (if using Lightning features)
     ```
   - These variables enable authentication and secure webhook validation. The private key is used to generate JWT tokens for GitHub API access.

3. **Run the Application**:

   - Execute the bot with: `python __main__.py`.
   - This starts the webhook server, typically on a local port (e.g., 8000), listening for GitHub events.
   - For local testing, use a tunneling tool like smee.io:
     ```
     smee --url https://smee.io/your_unique_channel --target http://localhost:8000/webhook
     ```
     Update your GitHub App's webhook URL to the smee.io URL to forward events locally.
   - In production, deploy to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS) with HTTPS enabled, and set the webhook URL to your deployed endpoint. Ensure the server runs persistently, perhaps using a process manager like supervisor.
